# UFOs

## Overview
Our client requested to help create a table to organize UFO data.  The data and website was to have capability to filter the UFO data based on certain criteria.  Our objective was to describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Results
We were able to create a simple search website while allowing Dana practice to use newly obtained skills with her JavaScript knowledge. For those who want to make basic searches for UFO analysis, can now you this website to do so.  Dana was able to, with our help, use the newly found skills, with the update to produce a UFO friendly fact finding website.  Dana and other users are able to input criteria under the "Filter Search" to refine information.  


## Challenge Summary
The option to search comments for more unique phrases or statments might a nice design upgrade. Overall this is a pretty basic search tool that could be greatly expanded to do a great deal more. I would also recommend to maybe elimate or not require certain filters in the search to get a broader report for some users. I also belive the website could benefit from a subpage that could help new and upcoming researches to get a more in depth scope of how the die hards would use the research.
